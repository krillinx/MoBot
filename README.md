# MoBot
This is MoBot - a cutsom Discord Bot.

Nah, but seriously, enjoy what is here. There's not many comments and it's a mess in the older files, but in case I die, now someone can else run this shit.

MoBot is a bot that hosts custom features for other servers. Instead of making multiple little bots, it has been found easier to have one bot for everything. MoBot isn't just for organization, it's not just for moderation, it's simply a jack of 'most' trades. It's contiously beeing updated to include more features per request, donation, and as seen fit.

Feel free to join the support server to stay up to date on all things MoBot https://discord.gg/bgyEpEh, or feel free to invite the bot yourself https://discordapp.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=449247895858970624&scope=bot&permissions=469920856.
